# Psychic-Game

Welcome to my Psychic Game where I will challenge you to guess what letter I am thinking of!

I have used Javascript and HTML to create this simple game to reflect my advancing skillset in leveraging these languages.

## Instructions

1. Using your keyboard press a letter that you think I am thinking of.
1. If you are right the number of wins will increase.  Good Job!
1. If you are incorrect I will you give you 5 attempts which will count down next to Guesses Left.  After 5 incorrect guesses I will increase the number of losses.
1. #### Good luck!
